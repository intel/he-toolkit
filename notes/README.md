# Notes

These are notes about the mathematical background of Homomoprhic Encryption.
They include LATEX notes on,
- "Number Theory"
- "Groups"
- "Rings"

- "Advanced Topics"
They also include presentations about some of these topics.

To build the latex files we recommend using `latex-mk` program.

```bash
latex-mk [--pdflatex] <latex-file>
```
the `--pdflatex` is if you want a PDF file instead of a DVI file.
