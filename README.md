# Intel Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit
The Intel Homomorphic Encryption (HE) toolkit is designed to make it fast and
easy to evaluate homomorphic encryption technology on IntelÂ® Processors using
libraries, such as [Intel HE Acceleration Library](https://github.com/intel/hexl), optimized to
take advantage of the newest Intel hardware features.  Additionally, the Intel
HE-Toolkit is a great starting point for people new to homomorphic encryption,
offering sample kernels showing multiple examples of how the libraries can be
used to implement common mathematical operations using
[Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL),
[PALISADE](https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-release), or
[HElib](https://github.com/homenc/HElib). In addition, there are example
applications which demonstrate how HE technology can be used to create secure
applications.

## Dependencies
Intel HE toolkit has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04

Must have system dependencies for the toolkit include,
```
git
python >= 3.8
```

Further Python dependencies include,
```
toml
argparse (optional for tab completion)
pytest (optional for running tests)
```

However, to build anything useful with the toolkit, we recommend that in
addition the following, system dependencies,

```
m4
patchelf
cmake >= 3.13
g++ >= 10.0 or clang >= 10.0
pthread
virtualenv
autoconf
```

Specific system dependencies for toolkit components can be found in the respective
directory of each HE component.


## Instructions
Intel HE toolkit is primarily accessible through the `hekit` command.
There are currently two ways of interacting with the toolkit: through a Docker
build; or, directly on your system.

### The hekit command
The `hekit` subcommands can be used by the user to easily setup the required
environment to evaluate HE technology. See the [README](kit/README.md) for
instructions.

### Docker build (Recommended)
The **recommended** method is to use the Docker build and installation which
builds the toolkit in its entirety including all HE libraries in a
self-contained docker container running Ubuntu 20.04. See [here](docker) for a
detailed description on the usage and components of this build.

### System build of toolkit's HE components
Alternatively, one can build the toolkit's HE components using the following commands

```bash
cd <path/to/toolkit>/he-samples
hekit install recipes/default.toml
```

This will build the toolkit project with the default settings. The toolkit will
download and build all three HE libraries automatically with Intel HE Acceleration Library enabled.

**Note:** You will be responsible for installing all of the required
[dependencies](#dependencies).


## Kernels
Located in [he-samples](he-samples) is a collection of software components
built on Microsoft SEAL and PALISADE comprising sample kernels for operations
performed homomorphically and example applications. The HE Samples are designed
to enable quicker evaluation of HE on Intel platforms, serve as a learning tool
for how to implement operations in different HE libraries, and provide examples
of how these operations can be used to build applications based on HE
technology for different use cases.

### Sample kernels
The [sample kernels](he-samples/sample-kernels) are for complex HE operations,
requiring multiple API calls such as Matrix Multiplication and Vector Dot
Product.  See the [README](he-samples/sample-kernels/README.md) for
instructions.

### Test sample kernels
The [unit tests](he-samples/sample-kernels/test) are a selection of unit tests
meant for verifying the accuracy of the various sample kernels included in this
project.  See the [README](he-samples/sample-kernels/test/README.md) for
more information.


## Examples
The [examples](he-samples/examples) directory includes example applications
built using HE technology. The primary purpose of these examples is to serve as
a showcase of different use cases which can be implemented using HE. Moreover,
these can be used as learning references and starting points for further
development. The toolkit currently includes the following examples listed
below.

### Secure Query
The [secure query](he-samples/examples/secure-query) example shows how it is
possible to implement a key-value database using HE. This allows a client to
perform lookups of values in the database without exposing the query to the
server hosting the database and optionally the key-value pairs in the database
as well. The secure query example is implemented using the SEAL BFV scheme. See
the [README](he-samples/examples/secure-query/README.md) for more details and
instructions on how to run this program.

### Logistic Regression
The transposed [logistic regression](he-samples/examples/logistic-regression)
example presents a scalable and fast method of logistic regression inference in
HE. Using the SEAL CKKS scheme, the example will encrypt the model (bias and
weight) and takes batches of encrypted data samples to perform the inference
all within the HE domain. See the
[README](he-samples/examples/logistic-regression/README.md) for usage
information.

### Private Set Intersection
The [Private Set Intersection (PSI)](he-samples/examples/psi) example computes the intersection of two
given sets. The program computes a hash value for each entry of both the client
and the server sets, then using the HElib BGV scheme, it encrypts the client
set and computes the intersection, returning all the encrypted elements that
are common to both sets. See the [README](he-samples/examples/psi/README.md)
for usage information.

## Troubleshooting ##

* ```Executable `cpplint` not found```

  Make sure you install cpplint: ```pip install cpplint```.
  If you install `cpplint` locally, make sure to add it to your `PATH`.

* ```/bin/sh: 1: pre-commit: not found```

  Install `pre-commit`. More info at https://pre-commit.com/.

* ```
     error: gpg failed to sign the data
     fatal: failed to write commit object
  ```
  Try adding ```export GPG_TTY=$(tty)``` to your shell initializer script such
  as `~/.bashrc`.
