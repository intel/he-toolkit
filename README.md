# Intel Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/intel/he-toolkit/actions/workflows/github-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/intel/he-toolkit/actions/workflows/github-ci.yml)

Intel Homomorphic Encryption (HE) Toolkit is Intel's primary platform for
delivering innovation around HE with the aim of providing both the community
and industry with an intuitive entry point for Experimentation, Development and
Deployment of HE applications. Intel HE Toolkit currently offers sample kernels
and example programs that demonstrate varying operations and applications that
can be built leveraging three major HE libraries [Microsoft
SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL),
[PALISADE](https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-release), and
[HElib](https://github.com/homenc/HElib). Moreover, Intel HE Toolkit
demonstrates the advantages of using IntelÂ® Processors through libraries such
as the [Intel HE Acceleration Library](https://github.com/intel/hexl) to
utilize the latest Intel hardware features.

## Dependencies
Intel HE toolkit has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04

Must have system dependencies for the toolkit include,
```
python >= 3.8
git
pip
```

Further Python dependencies include,
```
toml
argcomplete (optional: tab completion)
docker      (optional: building docker containers)
pytest      (optional: running tests)
pytest-mock (optional: running tests)
```

For faster setup, a `requirements.txt` file is provided for recommended user
python dependencies and a `dev_reqs.txt` is provided for all python dependencies
listed above. Either file can install dependencies with

```bash
pip install -r <requirements-file>
```

However, to build anything useful with the toolkit, we recommend to
additionally install the following system dependencies,

```
m4
patchelf
cmake >= 3.13
g++ >= 10.0 or clang >= 10.0
pthread
virtualenv (optional if building the Logistic Regression Example)
autoconf   (optional if using PALISADE)
gmp        (optional if using HElib)
```

## Setup
To set up the toolkit users must first initialize the `hekit` command using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/intel/he-toolkit.git
cd he-toolkit
./hekit init --default-config
```

This will create a directory `~/.hekit` in the user's home directory and create
the `default.config`, or other user specified config file to this location.
This directory will be where all components built and installed by `hekit` will
be kept.

Moreover, the `hekit` command will be added to the user's `PATH` so
as to enable the user to call the command from anywhere on their system. This
modifies your shell's initialization script (currently only in bash).

Intel HE toolkit is primarily accessible through the `hekit` command.  There
are currently two ways of interacting with the toolkit: through a Docker build
or directly on your system.

## The hekit command
The `hekit` command is a command-line tool that can be used by the user to
easily set up an HE environment in a configurable and intuitive manner.

The `hekit` command has a help option which lists all subcommands and flags
```bash
hekit -h
```

Moreover, each subcommand has a help option that can be invoked with `hekit
<subcommand> -h`.

The `hekit` subcommands consist of utility commands such as
`check-dependencies` and `docker-build` as well as commands for managing the
fetching, building, and installation of user-defined projects using recipe
files (more information found [here](kit/README.md#recipe-file)).
See the [README](kit/README.md) for more detailed information on the usage of
`hekit`.

## Docker build (Recommended)
The **recommended** method is to use the Docker build and installation which
builds the toolkit in its entirety including all HE libraries in a
self-contained docker container running Ubuntu 20.04. This can be built through
the `hekit` command
```bash
hekit docker-build
```
See [here](docker) for a detailed description on the usage and components of
this build.

## System build
Alternatively, one can build the toolkit's HE components using the following
command

```bash
hekit install recipes/default.toml
```

This will build the toolkit project with the default settings. The toolkit will
download and build all three HE libraries automatically with Intel HE
Acceleration Library enabled.

**Note:** You will be responsible for installing all of the required
[dependencies](#dependencies).

The [sample kernels](he-samples/sample-kernels) and [examples](he-samples/examples) can also be built in a
similar manner using
```bash
hekit build recipes/sample-kernels.toml
```
and
```bash
hekit build recipes/examples.toml
```
respectively.

To view a list of the components and their instances have been built/installed
through `hekit` one can execute
```bash
hekit list
```
to list each component, their instance(s) and the status of the fetch, build,
and install steps.

## Kernels
Located in [he-samples](he-samples) is a collection of software components
built on Microsoft SEAL and PALISADE comprising sample kernels for operations
performed homomorphically and example applications. The HE Samples are designed
to enable quicker evaluation of HE on Intel platforms, serve as a learning tool
for how to implement operations in different HE libraries, and provide examples
of how these operations can be used to build applications based on HE
technology for different use cases.

### Sample kernels
The [sample kernels](he-samples/sample-kernels) are for complex HE operations,
requiring multiple API calls such as Matrix Multiplication and Vector Dot
Product.  See the [README](he-samples/sample-kernels/README.md) for
instructions.

### Test sample kernels
The [unit tests](he-samples/sample-kernels/test) are a selection of unit tests
meant for verifying the accuracy of the various sample kernels included in this
project.  See the [README](he-samples/sample-kernels/test/README.md) for
more information.


## Examples
The [examples](he-samples/examples) directory includes example applications
built using HE technology. The primary purpose of these examples is to serve as
a showcase of different use cases which can be implemented using HE. Moreover,
these can be used as learning references and starting points for further
development. The toolkit currently includes the following examples listed
below.

### Secure Query
The [secure query](he-samples/examples/secure-query) example shows how it is
possible to implement a key-value database using HE. This allows a client to
perform lookups of values in the database without exposing the query to the
server hosting the database and optionally the key-value pairs in the database
as well. The secure query example is implemented using the SEAL BFV scheme. See
the [README](he-samples/examples/secure-query/README.md) for more details and
instructions on how to run this program.

### Logistic Regression
The transposed [logistic regression](he-samples/examples/logistic-regression)
example presents a scalable and fast method of logistic regression inference in
HE. Using the SEAL CKKS scheme, the example will encrypt the model (bias and
weight) and takes batches of encrypted data samples to perform the inference
all within the HE domain. See the
[README](he-samples/examples/logistic-regression/README.md) for usage
information.

### Private Set Intersection
The [Private Set Intersection (PSI)](he-samples/examples/psi) example computes
the intersection of two given sets. The program computes a hash value for each
entry of both the client and the server sets, then using the HElib BGV scheme,
it encrypts the client set and computes the intersection, returning all the
encrypted elements that are common to both sets. See the
[README](he-samples/examples/psi/README.md) for usage information.

## Known Issues
* Running ```./hekit init --default-config``` produces the error
  ```ValueError: Unknown shell 'sh'```
  The `hekit` command currently only supports `bash`, please ensure the default
  shell is set to `bash` or alternatively set the environment variable `export
  SHELL=/bin/bash`.

* There is a specific hardware configuration, `AVX512DQ`, which causes some of
  the PALISADE sample kernels to fail when building the HEXL library with
  PALISADE. This error seems independent of the HE Toolkit and is currently
  being investigated.

## Adding a New Command

The following steps allows to add a new subcommand to `hekit` as a command or
tool. Below `ACTION` must be replaced by a word or set of words that
described the functionality of the new command.

* Create a new python file ACTION.py inside either the [commands](kit/commands)
  directory or the [tools](kit/tools) directory.

* Create a function to set the parser of the subcommand (the subparser to
  `hekit` parser).  The function must begin and end with `set_` and
  `\_subparser`, respectively.  Define the arguments of the command. The
  parameter of the function `set_defaults(fn)` must be set to the function
  defined in the next step.  Check
  [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#action) for API
  reference information.
  ```python
  def set_ACTION_subparser(subparsers):
      """create the parser for the 'ACTION' command"""
      parser_ACTION = subparsers.add_parser("ACTION", description="ADD-SUBPARSER-DESCRIPTION")
      parser_ACTION.add_argument(
          "ARG1", description="ADD-ARG-DESCRIPTION"
      )
      parser_ACTION.add_argument(
          "ARG2", description="ADD-ARG-DESCRIPTION"
      )
      parser_ACTION.set_defaults(fn=NEW_FUNCTIONALITY)
  ```

* Create the set of functions that implement the new functionality. The entry
  point must be a function that has `args` as parameter and it will use the
  arguments defined in the previous step.
  ```python
  def NEW_FUNCTIONALITY(args) -> None:
      """Executes new functionality"""
      if(args.ARG1)
          pass
      elif(args.ARG2)
          pass
  ```

* The file [hekit.py](kit/hekit.py) has the logic to automatically discover the
  function `set_ACTION_subparser` and enable the options of the new
  command.

* Generic utilities or helper functions that can be used for several commands
  should be in [utils](kit/utils).


## Troubleshooting

* ```Executable `cpplint` not found```

  Make sure you install cpplint: ```pip install cpplint```.
  If you install `cpplint` locally, make sure to add it to your `PATH`.

* ```/bin/sh: 1: pre-commit: not found```

  Install `pre-commit`. More info at https://pre-commit.com/.

* When attempting to sign a commit
  ```
  error: gpg failed to sign the data
  fatal: failed to write commit object
  ```
  Try adding ```export GPG_TTY=$(tty)``` to your shell initializer script such
  as `~/.bashrc`.
