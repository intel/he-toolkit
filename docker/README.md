# Quick start

# Dependencies
This has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04
  Docker version 20.10.x

If you don't have docker in your system, here are the quick installation instructions
to install Docker from a standard Ubuntu Repository:
  https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa

Alternatively you can also install Docker from docker.com, See instructions at
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/


# Build
To build the base Ubuntu 20.04 image from within this directory
run the following command
```bash
./setup_and_run_docker.sh
```
This will build the docker images and you should be entered into a command prompt
inside the toolkit docker container.
