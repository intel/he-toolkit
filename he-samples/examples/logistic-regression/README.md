Logistic Regression with Homomorphic Encryption

# Requirements
```
python3 >= 3.5
virtualenv or python3-venv
```
Packages needed for generating the synthetic datasets are automatically installed in a virtual environment within ```$HE_SAMPLES/build/examples/logistic-regression/datasets/```.

# Usage
```bash
cd $HE_SAMPLES/build/examples/logistic-regression
./lr_test
```

## Flags
```--data```: Dataset name. Default is ```lrtest_mid```. There are four different synthetic datasets available for testing, which are automatically generated during build time.

| Name | Features | # Samples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lrtest_small | 40 | 500 |
| lrtest_mid | 80 | 2000 |
| lrtest_large | 120 | 10000 |
| lrtest_xlarge | 200 | 50000 |


```-poly_modulus_degree```: Polynomial modulus degree, which determines the encoding slot count (half of the parameter) and encryption security level. Default is ```8192```, and recommended size is ```{4096, 8192, 16384}```, and must be a power of 2, with full range of ```[1024, 32768]```.

```--docompare```: Compare the HE logistic regression inference result with non-HE inference for validation purposes. Default is ```false```.

## Data Preparation
There are two example data preparation ipython notebooks in [datasets](datasets) folder.
