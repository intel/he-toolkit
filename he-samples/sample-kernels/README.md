# Sample Kernels
This directory contains sample kernels implemented using google test and google
benchmark for Microsoft SEAL and PALISADE. These sample kernels are for
operations that are not full standalone use cases. An example of such an
operation is matrix multiplication for which we provide several different
sample kernels showing alternative methods of implementing the same algorithm
using different approaches, libraries, and schemes. The full set of available
sample kernels for each library and a brief description are described in the
details section below.

# Usage
This directory contains sample kernels which benchmark a set of more complex
HE operations in both SEAL and PALISADE.  Assuming the sample kernels were
built via `hekit` using the provided recipe `sample-kernels.toml` they can
run by calling

```bash
# Note, these will take several minutes
$HOME/.hekit/components/sample-kernels/seal/build/sample-kernels-seal
$HOME/.hekit/components/sample-kernels/palisade/build/sample-kernels-palisade
```
This will output timing results using google benchmark.

For the sample kernel unit tests, run
```bash
$HOME/.hekit/components/sample-kernels/seal//build/test/unit-test
$HOME/.hekit/components/sample-kernels/palisade//build/test/unit-test
```

# Details
The following tables list and give a brief description of the different sample
kernels available. All sample kernels use N = 8192 with 3 Coefficient modulus
primes.
